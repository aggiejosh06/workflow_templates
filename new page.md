# Create a new page

To create a new page you need at least a controller and a view. You can create both at the same time by using the rails controller generator.

`rails generate controller [controller name] [name of any actions you want to include]`

Remember the rails naming conventions here and make the controller name plural if possible. The actions argument is optional but can be a quick shortcut.
